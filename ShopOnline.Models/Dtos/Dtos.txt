DTO stands for Data Transfer Object. DTOs are objects used to transfer data between different layers or components of an application. They are used to encapsulate data and provide a standardized format for communication.

Here are some reasons why DTOs are used:

Data encapsulation: DTOs encapsulate data from the underlying data models/entities. 
They provide a separate representation of data that can be used to transfer only the necessary information between different layers or components of an application.

Data transformation: DTOs allow for transforming and shaping data from one format to another. 
For example, they can be used to flatten or combine data from multiple entities into a single object, making it easier to consume or display in a specific context.

Reducing over-fetching and under-fetching: In some scenarios, the data required by the client or consumer may not align perfectly with the structure of the underlying data models. 
DTOs can be used to fetch and transfer only the required data, avoiding over-fetching (retrieving more data than needed) or under-fetching (not retrieving enough data).

Versioning and backward compatibility: DTOs can help with versioning and maintaining backward compatibility in APIs. 
By using DTOs, you can control the structure and representation of data exposed through the API, allowing for changes in the underlying data models without affecting the API contract.

Security and privacy: DTOs can be used to expose a subset of data while hiding sensitive or private information. 
They provide a layer of abstraction that allows controlling what data is exposed to the client or consumer.

Optimizing performance: DTOs can help improve performance by reducing the amount of data transferred between layers. 
By sending only the required data, network bandwidth and processing time can be reduced.
Overall, DTOs provide a structured and standardized way to transfer data between different parts of an application, helping to decouple the layers and components and providing flexibility and control over the data being transferred.
